        <h2>Critical Analysis</h2>
        <div style="text-align: justify;">
          <h3>Description:</h3>
          <p>
            During my Work Integrated Learning (WIL) placement at Solis Security, I was tasked with contributing to the Automatic Data Quality Improvement project. Solis Security is a leading cybersecurity company operating across Australia, the US, and the UK, specializing in providing advanced cyber defence solutions. My role primarily involved enhancing data handling processes and improving model efficiency for better detection of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and reducing data redundancy.
          </p>
          
          <h3>Interpretation:</h3>
          <p>
            Throughout the placement, I undertook several key responsibilities including conducting research on anomaly detection, developing a prototype detection algorithm, and managing comprehensive datasets for machine learning training. One of the significant tasks was implementing the Local Outlier Factor (LOF) model to detect anomalies within data clusters. This model helped in identifying and mitigating noise within the data, thereby improving overall data quality.
          </p>
          <p>
            During the early stages, I faced challenges in clustering diverse data types effectively. For instance, documents containing heavy text or images required different approaches for accurate anomaly detection. This task taught me the importance of choosing appropriate data processing techniques to maintain data integrity and minimize false positives in anomaly detection.
          </p>

          <h3>Evaluation:</h3>
          <p>
            Reflecting on my actions during the placement, I recognize several areas where alternative approaches could have led to better outcomes. Initially, I focused heavily on a single anomaly detection model, which, although effective, could have been supplemented with additional models for comparative analysis. For example, integrating the Isolation Forest model alongside the LOF model might have provided a more robust anomaly detection framework.
          </p>
          <p>
            One of my strengths during the placement was my ability to adapt and learn new techniques rapidly. My prior knowledge of Python and data visualization tools like Matplotlib and Seaborn was instrumental in developing and presenting my findings. However, I realized that my understanding of advanced machine learning concepts, such as hyperparameter tuning, needed further improvement. Through iterative testing and validation, I enhanced my skills in this area, achieving better model accuracy and reliability.
          </p>

          <h3>Plan:</h3>
          <p>
            Moving forward, I am committed to continuous learning and professional development. To address the areas identified for improvement, I plan to undertake specialized courses in advanced machine learning algorithms and data science methodologies. Additionally, I aim to engage in projects that require the application of multiple anomaly detection models to broaden my analytical capabilities.
          </p>
          <p>
            Moreover, I will seek opportunities to participate in workshops and seminars related to data quality management and cybersecurity to stay updated with the latest industry trends and best practices. By doing so, I will be better equipped to handle complex data challenges and contribute effectively to future projects.
          </p>
          <p>
            In conclusion, my WIL placement at Solis Security was a valuable learning experience that enhanced my technical skills and provided practical insights into the application of data analytics in cybersecurity. This experience has reinforced my passion for data science and has motivated me to pursue further expertise in this field, aligning with my long-term career goals of becoming a proficient data analyst and machine learning expert.
