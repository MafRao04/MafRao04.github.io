        <h2>Critical Analysis</h2>
        <div style="text-align: justify;">
          <h3>Introduction‚Äù:</h3>
          <p>
            During my Work Integrated Learning (WIL) placement at Solis Security, a leading cybersecurity firm, I was assigned a comprehensive project focusing on the Automatic Data Quality Improvement. This project was aimed at enhancing data quality for the training of advanced language models, specifically improving the detection of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and reducing data redundancy. This critical reflection will dissect my actions, learnings, and areas for improvement during this placement using the DIEP framework to structure the analysis: Describe, Interpret, Evaluate, and Plan.
          </p>

          </p>
          
          <h3>Describe:</h3>
          <p>
            In the initial phase of my placement, I conducted extensive research on anomaly detection and drift detection techniques. My responsibilities included developing a prototype detection algorithm, managing comprehensive datasets for machine learning training, and conducting performance analyses using advanced data processing and visualization techniques such as UMAP and Matplotlib. Additionally, I implemented the Local Outlier Factor (LOF) model for anomaly detection to enhance data quality and model efficiency.          
          </p>
          
          <h3>Interpret:</h3>
          <p>
            My work significantly enhanced my understanding of data quality management and its critical role in cybersecurity. The hands-on experience allowed me to apply theoretical knowledge to real-world problems, reinforcing the importance of practical applications in a professional setting. The project underscored the necessity of continuous learning and adaptability, as I had to frequently adjust my approach based on new findings and feedback. For instance, my initial assumption that drift detection would be the primary technique for identifying data quality issues was challenged, leading me to pivot to anomaly detection methods, which proved more effective in our context. If we refer to the picture mentioned below, we can clearly observe that the fluctuations in the graph are of random nature which is more of an anomaly problem rather than drift.

          </p>
          <h3>Evaluate:</h3>
          <p>
            Reflecting on my actions, several strengths and areas for improvement emerge. One of my key strengths was the ability to conduct thorough research and apply it effectively, which was crucial in developing a robust detection algorithm. My technical skills in using Python and machine learning frameworks like Scikit-learn were significantly enhanced, allowing me to handle complex data processing tasks efficiently. Additionally, my problem-solving skills were tested and honed as I navigated various challenges, such as the unexpected issues with drift detection and the need for extensive hyperparameter tuning in the LOF model.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, there were areas where my performance could have been improved. Initially, I underestimated the complexity of managing large datasets and ensuring data integrity. This oversight led to delays in the early stages of the project as I had to revisit and rectify data handling processes. Furthermore, my communication with stakeholders could have been more proactive. While I ensured regular updates, more frequent and detailed briefings could have facilitated better alignment and faster decision-making.
          </p>

          <h3>Plan:</h3>
          <p>
            Moving forward, I am committed to addressing these areas for improvement. To enhance my data management skills, I plan to undertake advanced courses in data engineering and database management. This will equip me with a deeper understanding of efficient data handling techniques and tools, ensuring smoother project execution in the future. Additionally, I will focus on improving my stakeholder communication skills by adopting more structured and regular reporting practices, ensuring all parties are consistently informed and engaged.
          </p>
          <p>
            To maintain a trajectory of continuous learning, I will actively seek feedback and mentorship from experienced professionals in the field. Participating in relevant workshops and conferences will also be a priority to stay updated with the latest advancements in data quality management and machine learning. These steps will not only help in overcoming my current limitations but also prepare me for more complex challenges in my future career.
          </p>

          <h3>Conclusion:</h3>
          <p>
            The WIL placement at Solis Security was an invaluable experience that significantly contributed to my professional growth. Through critical reflection, I have identified both my strengths and areas for improvement, laying a clear path for future development. By addressing the gaps in my skill set and enhancing my strengths, I am confident in my ability to contribute effectively to future projects and advance in my career in data analytics and cybersecurity. This commitment to continuous learning and improvement aligns with the expectations of the industry and will be instrumental in achieving my long-term career goals.
